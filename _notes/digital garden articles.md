	> Digital gardens explore a wide variety of topics and are frequently adjusted and changed to show growth and learning, particularly among people with niche interests. Through them, people are creating an internet that is less about connections and feedback, and more about quiet spaces they can call their own.


	> Tom Critchlow, a consultant who has been cultivating [his digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) for years, spells out the main difference between old-school blogging and digital gardening. “With blogging, you’re talking to a large audience,” he says. “With digital gardening, you’re talking to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.”


	> As a slower, clunkier way to explore the internet, they revel in not being _the_ definitive source, just _a_ source, says Mike Caulfield, a digital literacy expert at Washington State University.


	> “By engaging in digital gardening, you are constantly finding new connections, more depth and nuance,” he says. “What you write about is not a fossilized bit of commentary for a blog post. When you learn more, you add to it. It’s less about shock and rage; it’s more connective.”

	> They're not following the conventions of the "_personal blog_," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.

	> The timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.

	> Blogging evolved in the Premium Mediocre culture of Millenialism as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content. Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns. Everyone now has a modern minimalist logo and an LLC.

	> It is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual ==cornucopia== that the web makes possible. [^1]

	> This patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it.

	> If any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a transferable format.

	> Ward Cunningham, the guy who invented the original wiki back in 1995, on the educational use of this new personal wiki technology
	
	> Your machine is a library not a publication device. You have copies of documents is there that you control directly, that you can annotate, change, add links to, summarize, and this is because the memex is a tool to think with, not a tool to publish with.

	>  The “conversational web”. A web obsessed with arguing points. A web seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought. A web where you weld information and data into your arguments so that it can never be repurposed against you. The web not as a reconfigurable model of understanding but of sealed shut presentations.

	> And this is crucial to our talk here, because these abilities – to link, annotate, change, summarize, copy, and share — these are the verbs of gardening.

	> we’re infatuated with the stream, infatuated with our own voice, with the argument we’re in, the 
point we’re trying to make, the people in our circle we’re talking to.

	> Homepages had a timeless quality, an index of interesting or useful or relevant things about a topic or about a person.
	> Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages, but they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page.

- [The Swale: Weaving between Garden and Stream](https://bonkerfield.org/2020/05/swale-garden-stream/)
	> The Stream is the blog, the news feed, the Twitter timeline, all that which flows past us in a line, delivered in discrete chunks, fixed in the fourth dimension with timestamps. The Garden is the wiki, the documentation, the Github repository, all that which continues to resemble itself, residing where it first cropped up, growing in spots, receding in others, what you see is the accumulation of all changes.

	- Swaleという、庭でも時系列の流れでもない概念と方法論。
	> A swale is a wide, flat stretch of land used to slow down water runoff and help it be reabsorbed into the earth.

	> The second article is from Tom Critchlow titled [Building a Digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). What I really like about Tom's piece is his discussion of the idea of "non-performative blogging" in your personal space on the web.

	> In French, “cultiver son jardin intérieur” means to _tend to your internal garden_—to take care of your mind. The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits).

	> To tend to your garden, you need to plant new ideas. The best way to do this is by replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas you’ve added to your garden—by consistently taking notes, and combining them together, a bit like grafting (Conor White-Sullivan, the founder of Roam, calls this [idea sex](https://nesslabs.com/conor-white-sullivan-interview)).

- 『コルヌトピア』（早川書房）の引用（庭園について）
	> 「庭園は個別的で、相補的で、常に破綻の危険を内包している。庭はそういう、存在のひとつのモードなんです。人間と、動植物たちとの間につくることができる、倫理の一形態。ここではない別の世界を発生させる思考を空間化したものです。」
